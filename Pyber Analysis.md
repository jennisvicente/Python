Urban cities have a higher number of rides demanding a higher number of drivers. This lowers the average fare total. 
In urban cities, rides may be shorter but may have spikes in price depending on the time and the availability of drivers. 
We may take in consideration in popular areas, such an airport, rules and systems may have been implemented to give the drivers
structure or irder in which the rides are assigned. Suburban areas, however, have a higher avarage fare. This may be due to the 
of the drop off. Less drivers would impact this average, but prices are less likely to spike unless there is a demand and 
a passanger is trying to get a ride. This can be seen in rural areas where the demand of rides might considerably raise the price
due to not enough drivers.
